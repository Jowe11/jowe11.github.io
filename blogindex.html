	<h2 class="ross">A Happy Lorem Ipsum</h2>
	<p class="quote">When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. I like to beat the brush. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.
	</p>

	<p>Let all these things just sort of happen. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.
	</p>

	<p>Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.
	</p>

	<p>Every time you practice, you learn more. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Isn't that fantastic?
